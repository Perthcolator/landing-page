          <h1>Perthcolator</h1>

          <p><em>Special Announcement, 11 April 2016</em></p>

          <p>The Perth startup community has been growing dramatically, and the founders within it are getting more knowledgeable and capable every year.</p>

          <p>But, as always, there is a need for more founders and better founders. The only way that Perth is going to overcome the tyranny of distance and take its place in the roster of great places to start a tech business is if we generate enough momentum. That takes a lot of businesses starting so that some of them succeed.</p>

          <p>There is also a large disconnect between investors in the city and the tech startups that will generate most of the returns in years to come. Investors don't know the industry, and have no networks that include suitable tech startup founders. They also aren't familiar with the investment model that the startup industry uses. Tech startups are starving for early-stage investment while investors have nowhere to put their money to good use.</p>

          <p>There is also a shortage of talent, especially technical talent to develop prototypes and products. The answer for many people has been to turn to offshore developers and development houses. Less than 5% of these projects are successful, for a variety of reasons but mostly because the outcomes for the developers and the startup are not aligned.</p>

          <p>There are initiatives already working to solve this, but (without wanting to take anything away from them) they’re piecemeal and sporadic. Accelerators based on cohorts only accept a small number of startups at a specific point in their development, and then give them all a single valuation and try to move them through the program at the same speed. One size does not fit all. And they only run once or twice per year whilst the demand for investment and mentoring is constant.</p>

          <p>Perthcolator is a new Startup Studio that aims to solve these problems. It provides constant year-round support, guidance and connection for tech startups, coupled with an investment fund for early-stage investment that provides investors with opportunities they will not find elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Incorporating the successful Fusion Founders program from Atomic Sky, the guidance part of the program brings Perth’s best and brightest experts in to help startups with the problems they face. Utilising the Customer Development model, the program identifies the stage the startup is at and the challenges it faces, and then connects the startup with the people it needs to overcome the challenge.</p>

          <p>The talent part of the program aims to solve the perennial tech talent shortage. By reaching out to universities, the freelancer network, and the community itself, Perthcolator will bring in talented individuals to provide specific skills to startups. Creating opportunities for students to enter the industry under guidance from experienced veterans is a key part of the platform.</p>

          <p>The investment part of the program provides a fund for early-stage investment in the startups going through the program. By identifying potentially successful startups in the program who are in need of funding, the investment fund gets first pick of tomorrow’s successes. The fund provides limited amounts of early-stage funding, with the option to invest more at discount when the startup reaches the next round. This is the high-risk, high-return investment that the industry needs and that investors need.</p>

          <p>Perthcolator is due to start in late 2016, so
